Frontend Overview
1. Main Dart File

A main.dart file was created to start the Flutter app and display the e-commerce website.

Included basic UI screens to showcase connection with the backend for authentication and product display.

2. Pubspec.yaml

pubspec.yaml was updated with dependencies required for Flutter, including HTTP for backend requests.

This allowed smooth communication between frontend and backend services.

Database Overview

A PostgreSQL database was set up using pgAdmin to store user, product, and order information.

Entities in Spring Boot were designed to map to database tables using JPA/Hibernate.

Database settings are configured to connect the backend and store relevant information for the e-commerce application.
